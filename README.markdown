# README

Example app that runs all kinds of shit in threads.

## How it works

Everything in `lib/threads/*.rb` gets spawned in a `Thread.new` (and supervised!)

Sidekiq, since it's popular, is also included.

Clockwork, for timed jobs, is included as well.  Further only one instance of clockwork is spun up, no matter how many rails app instances are launched (using SingletonProcess is a really bad ZooKeeper).

## What's different

Per view stylesheets and javascripts are not included in every view.

Instead, per-view assets are loaded after corresponding application.js and application.css

This is more efficient to first page load since assets only the minimal assets are loaded.

## Easy setup

    git clone https://github.com/steakknife/rails41rc_plus_hacks_and_threads
    cd rails41rc_plus_hacks_and_threads
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    foreman start
