## How it works

Everything in `lib/threads/*.rb` gets spawned in a `Thread.new` (and supervised!)

Sidekiq, since it's popular, is also included.  Sidekiq workers live at `lib/workers/*.rb`

Clockwork, for timed jobs, is included as well `lib/clocks/*.rb`.  Further only one instance of clockwork is spun up, no matter how many rails app instances are launched (using SingletonProcess is a really bad ZooKeeper).


`lib/hacks/early/**/*.rb` are loaded early by config/boot.rb unless env `HACKS=n`

`lib/hacks/late/**/.rb` are loaded later by config/environment.rb unless env `HACKS=n`


## What's different

Per view stylesheets and javascripts are not included in every view.

Instead, per-view assets are loaded after corresponding application.js and application.css

This is more efficient to first page load as only the minimal assets are loaded.

## Easy setup

    git clone https://github.com/steakknife/rails_plus_hacks_and_threads
    cd rails_plus_hacks_and_threads
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    foreman start

## Requirements

- ruby 2.1.1
- postgres
- rake
- bundler

## Configuration

Can be set externally (such as heroku) or locally in config/application.yml

### Standard

- RAILS_ENV # defaults to development
- PORT # defaults to 3000 without foreman, 5000 with
- DATABASE_URL

- PUMA_MIN_THREADS
- PUMA_MAX_THREADS
- PUMA_WORKERS # no. of processes
- PUMA_CONTROL_ENDPOINT
